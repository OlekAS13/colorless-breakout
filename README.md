# Colorless Breakout
Breakout from 1976 by Atari in its basic form

## About
This is the same as __Breakout__ but without colors. In the original machines the game was rendered like this, just pure white, then the colored screen was added that created the illusion of colored bricks and paddle. It's interesting experience to play this game in this form. You could achieve the game to look like this with the original machine by redirecting the video output to different monitor that didn't have the colored parts on it.

### Have fun!
